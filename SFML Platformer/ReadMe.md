    SFML Platformer Project Overview

This is an application which uses way too many pointers for its own good
and at this point I'm not even sure why but its something to do with 
how things get deleted when the function that creates them terminates

After that I'm too lazy to implement proper destroyers that free all
the pointers when I'm done with them so we'll just...have that problem
disappear for now
